Memory Game 
In this project, students build a browser-based card matching game. The students used their base knowledge of Javascript, CSS, and HTML.
In this game, the goal was to click two cards at a time. As the player plays their moves a track each time, they click two cards. The more moves they make their rates go down. Once the player matches all the cards game is over.
